# Dashboard UX Improvements - Product Requirements Document

## 📋 Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the enhancement of CoachMaster's dashboard with modern UX features including parallax scrolling effects, interactive charts, and social media sharing capabilities. The goal is to elevate user engagement and provide a more visually appealing, interactive experience for coaches managing their teams.

## 🎯 Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Enhanced Visual Appeal**: Transform static statistics into dynamic, interactive visual elements
2. **Improved User Engagement**: Implement parallax scrolling to create depth and movement
3. **Social Sharing**: Enable coaches to share team statistics as professional-looking images
4. **Mobile-First Experience**: Ensure all improvements are optimized for mobile devices

### Success Metrics
- Increased dashboard session time by 40%
- User engagement with interactive elements (charts/parallax) > 70%
- Social sharing feature adoption rate > 25%
- Maintain < 100ms rendering performance on mobile devices

## 🔍 Current State Analysis

### Existing Dashboard Components
- **Team Statistics Card**: 8 static metrics in 2x4 grid layout
- **Player Carousel**: 2 players per view with swipe navigation
- **Leaderboards Section**: Top 5 players by position with basic styling
- **Speed Dial FAB**: 3 action buttons for adding entities

### Pain Points Identified
1. **Static Presentation**: Statistics displayed as plain numbers without visual context
2. **Limited Interactivity**: No engagement beyond basic scrolling and navigation
3. **Missed Social Opportunities**: No way to share achievements or team progress
4. **Flat Design**: Lacks visual depth and modern appeal

## 🚀 Proposed Features

### 1. Parallax Scrolling Effects

#### Feature Description
Implement subtle parallax scrolling to create visual depth and movement throughout the dashboard.

#### Technical Approach

- Implement `SliverAppBar` with flexible space for hero section
- Add parallax background elements that move at different speeds
- Utilize `AnimatedBuilder` for optimized performance

#### Visual Elements
- **Header Parallax**: Team logo/image with slower scroll rate
- **Statistics Cards**: Staggered animation on scroll
- **Background Elements**: Subtle geometric patterns with depth effect

### 2. Interactive Charts System

#### Feature Description
Replace static statistics with animated, interactive charts that provide better data visualization.

#### Chart Types Implementation
1. **Win/Loss Pie Chart**: Visual representation of match results
2. **Goals Timeline**: Line chart showing goals scored over time
3. **Player Performance Radar**: Individual player statistics visualization
4. **Team Progress Bar**: Animated progress indicators for key metrics

#### Technical Specifications
- **Library**: fl_chart (lightweight, customizable, performant)
- **Animation Duration**: 800ms with easing curves
- **Interaction**: Touch to highlight segments, tap for details
- **Responsive**: Adapt to different screen sizes

#### Chart Components

##### Win/Loss Distribution Chart
```dart
PieChart(
  data: [
    PieChartSectionData(value: wins, color: Colors.green),
    PieChartSectionData(value: draws, color: Colors.orange),
    PieChartSectionData(value: losses, color: Colors.red),
  ],
  animation: Duration(milliseconds: 800),
)
```

##### Goals Over Time Chart
```dart
LineChart(
  LineTouchData(enabled: true),
  titlesData: FlTitlesData(show: true),
  gridData: FlGridData(show: true),
  borderData: FlBorderData(show: true),
)
```

### 3. Statistics Sharing System

#### Feature Description
Enable coaches to generate and share professional-looking team statistics as images on social media platforms.

#### Core Functionality
1. **Widget Screenshot**: Capture any dashboard section as high-quality image

## 🎨 Visual Design Specifications

### Color Palette Enhancement
```dart
// Enhanced theme colors for charts and parallax
class AppColors {
  static const Color primary = Color(0xFFFFA700);
  static const Color chartGreen = Color(0xFF4CAF50);
  static const Color chartRed = Color(0xFFE53E3E);
  static const Color chartBlue = Color(0xFF3182CE);
  static const Color parallaxBackground = Color(0xFF0A0A0A);
}
```

### Animation Specifications
- **Parallax Speed**: Background moves at 0.5x scroll speed
- **Chart Animations**: Staggered entrance with 100ms delays
- **Micro-interactions**: 200ms hover/press feedback
- **Page Transitions**: 300ms slide animations
